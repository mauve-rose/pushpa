It is a finger print device!!! Your parents got it installed by Nidhi (robot)!!! And your parents made YOU be the first person to try it!!!
You are worried if it blasts or something but, you take a deep breath and scan YOUR finger print...but does it blast??? Nope!!! Does it HACK YOU??? 
No...does it KILL YOU??? NEVER!!! It just starts water spray just like you wish at the time... half full blast, and also is at just the 
temrature you want... warm+a little hot!!! You guess it is not even that bad!!! </p> 
<h1>Chapter 3:The Future Resturant</h1>
<br>
 <p> You want to go to eat out with your friend Nidhi (human) and Ridima so you meet Nidhi+Ridima outside your house and walk and talk 
there at the restrant!!! you tap the menu on the ipad-like-table and order three pizzas three bowls of MAC and two Fanta and one 
Coka Gola to drink along with pizza and MAC (short  word for MAC and chesse (M for Mac A for And and C for Cheese=MAC))!!! So, 
then after a min a robot gives you what you ordered and you pay on the robot's body ipad the robot then just give you a free 
desert because you paid and the amout was 140$ but you gave a tip too so you and your friends got icecream because it was summer and you paid 200$ and
one icecream cost 20$ so you got three of them one for you, one for Nidhi, and one for Ridima!!!</p>
